            <p>Throw her in the brig. No, just a regular mistake. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of
                his humanity the way only a woman can. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to
                use the phrase "upside your head."</p>
            <p>No, just a regular mistake. How much did you make me? I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig
                died. I just told you! You've killed me! With gusto. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and
                then we'll go home.</p>
            <h2>And then the battle's not so bad?</h2>
            <p>Bender, quit destroying the universe! You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence
                never solved anything. Soon enough. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen
                seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without
                saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</li>
                <li>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</li>
                <li>No. We're on the top.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>And then the battle's not so bad?</h3>
            <p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love
                for you. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me
                the death penalty?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</li>
                <li>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
                </li>
                <li>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start
                    cracking wise about our mamas.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Good news,
                everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! A true inspiration for the children. It's just
                like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns
                for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and
                the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting
                through to you?</p>
            <p>Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Fetal stemcells, aren't
                those controversial? That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</p>
            <p>Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Check it
                out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease
                to exist!</p>
            <p>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. You lived before you met me?! There's one way and only one way
                to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in
                a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up
                that ol' mess you caused.</p>
            <p>It's toe-tappingly tragic! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Does anybody else feel
                jealous and aroused and worried? Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I
                could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</p>
            <p>When will that be? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate
                intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! All I want is to be a
                monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
            <p>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! So, how 'bout them Knicks? Anyone who laughs is a communist!
                Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.</p>
            <p>Tell them I hate them. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
                Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you
                jerk!</p>
            <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind
                against me! You're going to do his laundry? I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title
                of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</p>
            <p>Bite my shiny metal ass. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit
                with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Good news, everyone!
                I've taught the toaster to feel love!</p>
            <p>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To
                shreds, you say. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental
                illness.</p>
